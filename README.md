# CASTHLScanStats
Objective of this script to is get the per application statics for time taken to scan and upload the results to CAST highlight for each application, LOC per application and identify the apps failed during the analysis. 

This script analyze log files generated by the Highlight tool and extracting relevant information such as application names, IDs, total time taken to scan and upload results. It also query Highlight results using API call to get the lines of code for each applicaiton. 

## Prerequisites
Before using this script, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Required Python packages (`requests`, `openpyxl`, `pandas`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required Python packages using pip (pip install -r requirements.txt)


## Usage
1. Prepare your `config.properties` file with the necessary parameters. Refer to the [config.properties](config.properties) template for the format.
2. Run the script: python HighlightLogParser.py
3. Follow the prompts to provide any additional input required.

## Configuration
The `config.properties` file should contain the following parameters:

- `root_directory`: Path to the root directory containing log files.
- `output_directory`: Path to the directory where output files will be saved.
- `bearer_token`: HL Token required for authentication.
- `api_url`: Base URL of the Highlight API.
- `CompanyID`: ID of the Highlight company.

## Output
- `HLLogReport.xlsx`: Excel file containing log analysis results.
- `HLAppsandLOC.csv`: File contains AppID, Application Name and Application LOC for all applications in CAST Highlight
- `HLLogSummaryReport.xlsx`: Excel file containing consolidated log analysis data, including application name, application ID, highligh logfile path, scan start and end times, total scan and upload time, and application LOC. If a scan fails due to an error, only partial information will be accessible; you can filter on 'Error' in total time to determine which failed during the scan.
